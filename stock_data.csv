NYSE President Lynn Martin gives Yahoo Finance her advice for leading through change after guiding the historic exchange through the Covid-19 pandemic. Martin explains that “people tend to view change as scary. I think that's human nature.” Her advice is to communicate on multiple levels, “communicate with peers, communicate with your manager and communicate with the people that work for you because everyone craves communication during change.” Additionally, Martin says, “work hard. Keep executing your job. Don't fall, don't fall victim to water cooler talk, particularly around change… And then the third piece of advice I tend to give people is raise your hand if there's something that interests you. If it is not in your current job description, raise your hand to volunteer to do it.” Lead This Way is a new series from Yahoo Finance that features big interviews with business leaders shaping our world today. In these one-on-one conversations with Wall Street’s titans, we uncover their perspectives on how they approach leadership - from innovative thinking to sheer perseverance.

The iconic New York Stock Exchange has survived through the Civil War and the September 11th attacks. The person who navigated the exchange through the most recent challenge, the Covid-19 pandemic is NYSE President Lynn Martin. In the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way, she conveys how communication and empowering customers is at the core of her leadership style. Martin, who became the NYSE President in September of 2022 is the second woman to fill that role in the institution’s long history. Coming from a tech background, she says that she is a data driven person and relies on numbers to tell her story. Having led the NYSE through the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, she stresses that open communication is key to any successful enterprise. NYSE and its parent organization Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), host 2400 listed companies. Martin sees her primary job as providing these companies the tools to grow their businesses, amplifying what she describes as the “tremendous power of our community.” Martin gives Yahoo Finance Correspondent Diane King Hall an overview of how the 231 year old exchange functions behind the scenes and how her leadership skills are rooted in communication and challenging her employees to think “out of the box”. She iterates, “I like to throw ideas out there. A lot of times I throw them out there for reactions…I want people to push back.” Beginning her career as a programmer at IBM, Martin did not envision herself as leading such a historic institution as the New York Stock Exchange. But now she seeks to encourage and inspire younger generations, saying, “I took a non-linear career path to this job. You could too.” She goes on to say, “I'm not about just operating today's New York Stock Exchange. I wanna build the New York Stock Exchange for the next 10 years from now, for 25 years from now, for the next 231 years. And I challenge my management team to do that every day.” Lead This Way is a new series that features big interviews with the business leaders shaping our world today.
